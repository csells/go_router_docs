Sometimes you want your app to redirect to a different location. The go_router
allows you to do this at a top level for each new navigation event or at the
route level for a specific route.

There are several considerations when it comes to redirection:
1. [Top-level Redirection](/top-level-redirection)
1. [Route-level Redirection](/route-level-redirection)
1. [Parameterized Redirection](/param-redirection)
1. [Multiple Redirections](/multi-redirection)
